- Add support for a Continuous Integration service.
- Add support for sub-module references.
- Add support for code coverage, linting, and testing status indicators.
- Add support for UMD and/or IIFE modules, which will require:
    - Babel transpiling after TypeScript.
    - Probably additional plug-ins for module resolution.

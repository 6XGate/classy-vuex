- Watcher improvements:
  - Create watcher tests.
  - Test the limits of what watchers may do and select or create an appropriate type of proxy.
  - Add a module `$watch` method for dynamically attached watchers.
  - Add support for using a getter method rather than a path for watchers.

  - Allow public use of local functions, or provide a public equivalent.
- General improvements:
  - Add support for sub-module references.
  - Support, or block, inheriting classes already decorated with `@Module`.

- Project improvements:
  - Add support for a Continuous Integration service.
  - Add support for code coverage, linting, and testing status indicators.
  - Add support for UMD and/or IIFE modules, which will require:

    - Probably additional plug-ins for module resolution.
  - Add additional features like those in
